- Under AMC (Yes/No)

   Note:
   - "Provide AMC No" line will be disabled until the user selects "Under AMC" option as "yes".
   - After successfully submitting the ticket creation, an autogenerated ticket no. will be displayed on the user's home screen with the subject line and date & time of ticket creation.
   - Once the admin solves the problem and writes the work they have done in the action taken field in the admin panel, the same should reflect in the user's home screen action taken column as well.
   - In the "Status" field, there will be three options: NOT DONE, PARTIALLY DONE, DONE. The user will select the status and submit it.
   - Once the user selects the status and clicks on the "submit" button, the status of the corresponding ticket should be reflected on the admin panel as well, so that the admin can trace the tickets.
